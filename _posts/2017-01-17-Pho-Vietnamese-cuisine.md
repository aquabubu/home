Pho is a Vietnamese noodle soup, which is very popular in Vietnam and there is a number of restaurant chains around the world. For me, I usually have it for breakfast or whenever I get a fever, it helps me recuperate really soon. But Vietnamese people like to eat Pho whenever they like, for breakfast, lunch or dinner. Pho's really **delicious and good for your health**.

There are many <span style="color:mediumvioletred">**types of beef pho**</span>  for you to choose:

Pho is served in a bowl with a specific cut of white rice noodles in clear beef broth, with thin cuts of beef (steak, fatty flank, lean flank, brisket) or meatballs in southern Vietnam.

Chicken pho is made using the same spices as beef, but the broth is made using only chicken bones and meat, as well as some internal organs of the chicken, such as the heart, the undeveloped eggs, and the gizzard.

For the spices, I always use the spice pack for saving time. And one more thing, you don't have to prepare all the spices, just choose what you want to make your favorite flavor and shallots can be replaced by onions.

You can put chilli as you wish or if you can't eat spicy thing, then just skip it. Actually, just skip everything that you don't like. I don't like onions and scallions so I skip them every time I cook Pho. :laughing: :laughing:
