Have you ever been through the hot summer in Asia countries? In the hottest day, it may reach over 30oC. This temperature is ok for those are Asian and already get familiar with the hot climate. However, if you are living in some countries that have the significant distinction of seasons like Korea then, you’ll just want to stay in air conditioned-room. And the Korean are so smart since they have special food for the summer that cools you down immediately. Guess what, it’s Naengmyeon (냉면) or cold noodles.

###  <span style="color:green"> Mul naengmyeon </span>

**Make the broth**

Wash the meat in cold water until clean. Then, take out and put in the pot with 5 cloves of garlic, 1/2 large onion before boiling for about 20 minutes, then control the heat to simmer.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Pick boiled meat, let cool and then cut into small pieces. The broth is then filtered with a clean cloth and adjust spices to taste. Let the broth cool down.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Prepare garnishes**

  * Wash and prepare sliced cucumber.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  * Cut the radish into 5cm long, 1.5cm wide and as thin as possible then soak in 1/4 tsp salt, 1/2 tsp sugar, 1/2 tsp chili powder and 1/2 tsp of vinegar for 20 minutes.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  * Take 1/4 of the pear, peel off and cut into thin slices and soak in sugar.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

  * Boil the chicken eggs until ripe, then pick out and drop into cold water, peel and cut in half.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

**Make the naengmyeon**

Cook Naengmyeon in boiling water for 2-3 minutes, add 1/2 tsp salt to boiling water. After that, pour it into the mesh, washed immediately under the cold water and rinse the noodles well in the icy water.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Put the noodles in the middle of the bowl. Cucumber, pear, radish, sliced beef and egg are placed on top, then the cold broth (put some ice into the broth) is poured into the edge of the bowl.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

###  <span style="color:darkred"> Bibim naengmyeon </span>

Quite similar to the way we prepare mul naengmyeon except that we need to make the sauce and don’t pour the broth in.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Put the pear, garlic, onion, pepper, hot pepper paste, soy sauce, salt, sugar, vinegar, and sesame oil in a blender and grind until creamy. Just make the sauce suits your taste and cool in refrigerator before eating.
{: style="text-align: justify;"}

Put the noodles in the middle of the bowl. Add the sauce you just make and the garnishes on the noodles. Now, just mix it well and enjoy it.

So, the important thing is that, be creative and just put the ingredients you like! If you don’t like beef, change to pork or chicken. If you want to eat fried egg, then fry, don’t boil (though the taste will not be like original Korean naengmyeon).

We often know about Korean famous kimchi (김지) or hot rice cakes (tteok-bokki), but with vibrant color, elegant taste that is easy to eat, cold noodles have cooled down the heat of hot summer and enrich the cuisine of this country. Naengmyeon is so famous and popular that you can find it in many restaurants in Korea at ~7,000krw ($7), but remember, Naengmyeon is a seasonal food that can only be enjoyed in summer. It may not available in other seasons.
