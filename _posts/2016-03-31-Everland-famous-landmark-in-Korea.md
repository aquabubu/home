If you want to go to South Korea and find a place to entertain – a bustling, funny and big enough for a whole day playing, why don’t you take a chance on Everland. It is a <span style="color:PaleVioletRed">**Korea's largest theme park** </span>, operated by SAMSUNG cooperation and located at the Everland Resort in Yongin City. Along with its main attractions, **Everland** includes a **zoo** and **water park** known as **Caribbean Bay**, but I’m not confidence wearing bikini so I just skip the Bay . I’ll show you in details about Everland theme park which has **5 different zones**: Global Fair, American Adventure, Magic Land, European Adventure, and Zootopia.

### <span style="color:deepskyblue"> Global Fair </span>
It’s primarily a place for food, souvenirs, and pictures. The cheerful music is played along the street lined with many beautiful architectures from all over the world. Once you enter the park, you’ll see this zone first. You can also find needed services such as stroller rental and lockers here. (I did take many nice photos here :camera:)

The cable car was also good. Slow speed helps you enjoy the scene!

### <span style="color:crimson"> American Adventure </span>
This zone is based on the theme of 500 years of American history, from the time when Columbus discovered the American Continent to the 1960s when Elvis Presley ruled the music record. In this zone, you can experience many thrilling games. (thrilling things are not my style, so I just took a look in this zone guys :sweat_smile:)

### <span style="color:blueviolet"> Magic Land </span>
Magic land is an area with buildings and rides, mostly for kids. There is a place called Aesop's Village - a cute little fairy tale land based on the fables of Aesop. Along with the rides, there are many restaurants and stands. I didn't spend much time here, but the Rotating House was good. :smile:

### <span style="color:olive"> European Adventure </span>
Wonderful flowers in a seasonal garden such as tulips, roses are in bloom throughout the year. This theme zone also provides many attractions especially the T-express - Korea's first wooden coaster with a prefabricated track, the first ride of this type in Asia, and the first to employ three trains. It is world's fourth steepest wooden roller coaster, world's ninth fastest, fourth tallest, and sixth longest wooden coaster. Due to the hillside, T-express also takes advantage of the high terrain.
