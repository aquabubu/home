In this post, I will introduce the attractions in Hong Kong that I've been during my itinerary.

## <span style="color:Green"> At the airport </span>
After arriving and finishing all the procedures, I took my time go around the restricted area since there are many shops. Once you go out of this area, you canâ€™t enter again. And, when I went out of the restricted area, I took all types of maps with me. I recommend you to take all of them (especially Hong Kong maps & MTR maps), they are placed near the customer service counter.

I bought 2 Otopus cards in the central circular counter labeled Train Express Ticket at HK$150 (~$19), including HK$50 for deposit and HK$100 for transportation. Before I left, I returned it and could get back the excess money and deposit, but it cost HK$10 for the service fee. I also bought a Hong Kong Tourist SIM Card 3G-free for 5 days HK$69 (~$8) at 7-Eleven store in the airport.
